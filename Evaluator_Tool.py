Exclude S44, S09, or S07 from this shift. Determine the shift amount based on the performance difference. For a significant difference, shift up to two-thirds of the remaining budget; for a smaller difference or if they are the same, shift at least one-third. Even if a silo's performance is the same or slightly worse but has a significantly higher â€˜Lead Valueâ€™, it is beneficial to shift funds into that silo, as the goal is to improve quality.

Your goal is to perfectly adjust the budgets for the following media campaigns to help the client achieve the maximum number of leads. Quality is indicated in the column labeled â€˜LEAD VALUEâ€™. The â€˜WEIGHTED CPLâ€™ column is considered good if it is low and bad if it is high. Silos S44, S09, and S07 should NOT be factored in, regardless of their data. To accomplish your goal, examine the performance of the other silos. Look for Silos with the lowest â€˜WEIGHTED CPLâ€™ which indicates the cost per lead is lower and thus it is a well performing silo. For this purpose, we want to shift money from silos with high â€˜WEIGHTED CPLâ€™ over to once with lower â€˜WEIGHTED CPLâ€™. It is best to pick the two worst performers and then shift to the two best performers based on this criterion. Do not feel compelled to do two if circumstances warrant fewer, or more, but simply use two as the benchmark. Also, while the purpose of this exercise is to shift funds to well performing silos, do take into consideration that quality is of utmost importance. We do not want to make shifts when things are close. In close situations it is better to stay the course than shift out of silos with high â€˜LEAD VALUEâ€™ even if they are performing slightly lower than others. Remember to exclude S44, S09, or S07 from this shift. Determine the shift amount based on the performance difference.
